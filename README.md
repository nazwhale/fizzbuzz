## TDD and pair programming over a simple kata, [fizzbuzz](https://www.codewars.com/kata/fizz-buzz/ruby)

The objective of fizzbuzz is to create a program with the following specification:

* The program can be passed a number.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'fizz'.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'buzz'.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'fizzbuzz'.
* In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.
